# CheeseCloth

Dealing with filtering based on params in Rails APIs is a pain.

Let's say the boss tells you that you need to implement an endpoint for fetching Events. This
endpoint needs to allow you to filter by a (possibly one-sided) date range, and also optionally only
include events that the current user is attending.

```
GET /api/events
      ?filter[start_date]=2016-10-1
      &filter[end_date]=2016-11-1
      &filter[current_user_attending]=true
```

Your controller action quickly becomes a nightmare. But waitâ€”you're a
good developer, and you extract these filters out into a `EventFilterer` object:

```rb
class EventFilterer
  attr_reader :scope, :user, :params

  def initialize(scope = Event.all, user, params)
    @scope = scope
    @user = user
    @params = params
  end

  def filtered_collection
    if parse_date(params[:start_date])
      @scope = @scope.where("starts_at > ?", params[:start_date])
    end

    if parse_date(params[:start_date])
      @scope = @scope.where("ends_at < ?", params[:start_date])
    end

    if parse_boolean[:current_user_attending]
      @scope = @scope.where_user_attending(user)
    end

    @scope
  end

  private

  def parse_date(iso_string)
    Time.zone.parse(iso_string || "")
  end

  def parse_boolean(bool_string)
    !["f", "false", "0", ""].includes?(bool_string)
  end
end
```

This is a win, right? Wrong! At least, it flies with your bossâ€”until she asks you to make these
params required, validate their format, and provide nice error messages whenever validation fails.
Better yet, she asks if you can add similar filters to another endpoint, meaning you have to DRY
up this solution.

Yikes. We can do better.

```rb
class EventFilterer
  include CheeseCloth

  scope -> { Event.all }

  param :start_date, :date, required: true
  param :end_date, :date, required: true
  param :current_user_attending, :boolean, required: true

  filter :start_date do
    scope.where("starts_at > ?", start_date)
  end

  filter :end_date do
    scope.where("ends_at < ?", end_date)
  end

  filter :current_user_attending do
    scope.where_user_attending(user)
  end

  def start_date_before_end_date
    throw "start date must be before end date" unless start_date <= end_date
  end
end
```

Using this in our controller is incredibly simple.

```rb
class EventsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    if filterer.valid?
      render json: filterer.filtered_collection
    else
      render json: { errors: filterer.errors }, status: 422
    end
  end

  private

  def filterer
    EventFilterer.new(params[:filter], user: current_user)
  end
end
```
